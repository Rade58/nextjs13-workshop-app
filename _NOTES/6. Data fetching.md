# IMPORTANT THINGS I FOUND OUT FROM THESE LINKS

`fetch` WAS SOMEHOW GOT AUGMENTED BY REACT TEAM SO IT CAN BE USED INSIDE SERVER COMPONENTS (IT HAS SUPERPOWERS AND ALSO IS EXTENDED BY NEXTJS) (THIS IS NOT window.fetch BECAUSE DON'T HAVE window ON THE SERVER)

request deduplication IS NOT THE ISSUE ANYMORE (OUT OF THE BOX BY REACT)

WE ARE ALLOWED TO CUSTOMIZE HOW TO CACHE CERTAIN DATA (BY NEXTJS)


WE CAN USE ORM LIKE `prisma` IN SERVER COMPONENTS (SINCE THIS IS SERVR WE DON'T NEED TO SEND REQUEST TO THE API) (SAME GOES FOR THIRD PARTY SDKs)

**SERVER COMPONENTS CAN BE async FUNCTIONS**

**WHEN USING fetch IN SERVER COMPONENTS, BY DEFAULT DATA WILL BE CACHED AND YOU WILL GET ONLY CACHED THING WHEN RELOADING THE PAGE (SO BY DEFAULT IT WILL BE TREATED AS STATIC DATA)**

**WE NEED MANUALLY TO OPT IN INTO ANOTHER TYPE OF CACHING IF WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE STATIC DATA**

## `use` HOOK (NOT YET ABLE TO USE IT) (IT WILL BE READY BY FEBRUARY OF 2023)

IT WILL HAVE SIMILAR BEHAVIOUR AS SWR OR ReactQuery

THIS IS ONLY FOR CLIENT COMPONENT OFCOURSE

# `generateStaticParams`

[Generate Static Params](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/generate-static-params)

IF WE HAVE DYNAMIC ROUTE, BUT WE NEED STATIC PARAMS, LIKE A BLOG POST; WE CAN USE MENTIONED FUNCTION

**I CAN LOOK AT THIS LIKE LIKE SOME EQUIVALENT TO `geStaticPaths`**

**AND WE DON'T NEED `getStaticProps` ANYMORE SINCE WE ARE USING SERVER COMPONENTS, AND WE WILL FETCH DATA INSIDE COMPONENT**

***

**FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU HAVE `/blog` AND YOU HAVE DYNAMIC `/blog/:slug`**

YOU WOULD

- **EXPORT `getStaticParams`  FUNCTION FROM THE `/blog`**
- **NOT EXPORT `getStaticParams` FROM `/blog/:slug`**

THIS IS DIFFERENT THAN ERLIER WHERE YOU WOULD EXPORT `getStticpaths` FROM THE PAGE WITH DYNAMIC ROUTE

**/blog WILL NOT GET THOSE PARAMS ETHER WAY, EVEN YOU EXPORT `generateStaticParams` FROM MENTIONED FUNCTION** 

**PAGE WITH APPROPRIATE SLUG WILL GET ITS PARAMS (`/blog/:slug`)**

**AND THEN YOU CAN FETCH DATA BY CALLING fetch DIRECTLY INSIDE SERVER COMPONENT, BY USING YOUR PARAMS THAT YOU GOT AS A PROP OF THE PAGE SERVER COMPONENT**

**IF YOU USED CATCH-ALL-ROUTES, YOUR PARAMS SLUG WILL BE ARRAY**
