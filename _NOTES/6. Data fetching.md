# Data Fetching


## POINT ONE

<https://intro-nextjs-v2-instructions.vercel.app/lessons/Data-fetching/fetching>

IMPORTANT THINGS:

`fetch` WAS SOMEHOW GOT AUGMENTED BY REACT TEAM SO IT CAN BE USED INSIDE SERVER COMPONENTS (IT HAS SUPERPOWERS AND ALSO IS EXTENDED BY NEXTJS) (THIS IS NOT window.fetch BECAUSE DON'T HAVE window ON THE SERVER)

request deduplication IS NOT THE ISSUE ANYMORE (OUT OF THE BOX BY REACT)

WE ARE ALLOWED TO CUSTOMIZE HOW TO CACHE CERTAIN DATA (BY NEXTJS)


WE CAN USE ORM LIKE `prisma` IN SERVER COMPONENTS (SINCE THIS IS SERVR WE DON'T NEED TO SEND REQUEST TO THE API) (SAME GOES FOR THIRD PARTY SDKs)

**SERVER COMPONENTS CAN BE async FUNCTIONS**

**WHEN USING fetch IN SERVER COMPONENTS, BY DEFAULT DATA WILL BE CACHED AND YOU WILL GET ONLY CACHED THING WHEN RELOADING THE PAGE (SO BY DEFAULT IT WILL BE TREATED AS STATIC DATA)**

**WE NEED MANUALLY TO OPT IN INTO ANOTHER TYPE OF CACHING IF WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE STATIC DATA**
