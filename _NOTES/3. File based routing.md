# File based Routing

<https://intro-nextjs-v2-instructions.vercel.app/lessons/Pages/defining-routes>

# SOME NEW THINGS TO TAKE NOTICE

## ROUTE GROUPING

YOU CAN DO ROUTE GROUPING BY ENCLOSING FOLDER NAME INSIDE `()`

THE THING INSIDE `()` WON'T BE PART OF THE ROUTE, IT WILL BE IGNORED

**BUT THINGS INSIDE THE GROUP CAN SHARE LAYOUT**

## AUXILIARY PAGE COMPONENTS (I LIKE TO CALL THEM LIKE THIS, BUT THE NEXTJS TEAM CALL THEM PAGES)

WE CAN USE THESE TO AUGMENT THE PAGE (WE CAN SAY THEY ARE TEMPLATES OF SOME SORT)

**`head`*** (I LOOK AT THIS LIKE A SUCCESSOR TO THE _document)

YOU PUT THERE METADATA THAT WOULD GO TO THE `<head?></head>` OF THE HTML DOCUMENT

**`layout`** (VERY POWERFULL)

NEW THINGS TO NOTICE:

**YOU CAN GET DATA INSIDE LAYOUTS AT SERVER TIME**

**THIS TIME YOU CAN DEFINE `html` `head` AS A PART OF THE LAYOUT**

AND IF WE DID DEFINE `head` AS A SIBLING OF layout; THAT THINGS FROM THE head WILL AUGMENT THE LAYOUT
