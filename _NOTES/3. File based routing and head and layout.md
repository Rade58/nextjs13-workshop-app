# File based Routing

<https://intro-nextjs-v2-instructions.vercel.app/lessons/Pages/defining-routes>

# SOME NEW THINGS TO TAKE NOTICE

## ROUTE GROUPING

YOU CAN DO ROUTE GROUPING BY ENCLOSING FOLDER NAME INSIDE `()`

THE THING INSIDE `()` WON'T BE PART OF THE ROUTE, IT WILL BE IGNORED

**BUT THINGS INSIDE THE GROUP CAN SHARE LAYOUT**

## AUXILIARY PAGE COMPONENTS (I LIKE TO CALL THEM LIKE THIS, BUT THE NEXTJS TEAM CALL THEM PAGES)

WE CAN USE THESE TO AUGMENT THE PAGE (WE CAN SAY THEY ARE TEMPLATES OF SOME SORT)

**`head`*** (I LOOK AT THIS LIKE A SUCCESSOR TO THE _document)

YOU PUT THERE METADATA THAT WOULD GO TO THE `<head?></head>` OF THE HTML DOCUMENT

**`layout`** (VERY POWERFULL)

NEW THINGS TO NOTICE:

**YOU CAN GET DATA INSIDE LAYOUTS AT SERVER TIME**

**THIS TIME YOU CAN DEFINE `html` `head` AS A PART OF THE LAYOUT**

AND IF WE DID DEFINE `head` AS A SIBLING OF `layout`; TAGS FROM THE `head` WILL AUGMENT OUR LAYOUT

## WE PASS `<head />` INSIDE LAYOUT

`<head />` will contain the components returned by the nearest parent
head.tsx. Find out more at https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/file-conventions/head

## ROOT LAYOUT

LAYOUT FOR EVERY SINGLE PAGE

AT LEAST ONE ROOT LAYOUT IS REQUIRED (IT WON'T WORK WITHOUT IT) (IF YOU HAVE ROUTE GROUPING YOU CAN HAVE MORE THAN ONE LAYOUT (WITHOUT USING THE ROOT ONE (/app/layout))(SO EVERY GROUP CAN HAVE LAYOUT FOR THEMSELFS (BUT IN MOST CASES, WHICH MEANS IF YOU ARE NOT USING GROUPING, YOU JUST HAVE ONE ROOT LAYOUT)))

## `template` IS A BIT DIFFERENT THAN `layout`

TEMPLATE WILL CHANE EVERY TIME THE ROUTE CHANGES (SO IT GETS RERENDERED) (THIS WOULD BE ONLY USEFULL WITH ANIMATIONS)

USE LAYOUT FOR THE MOST PART, ONLY WHEN YOU SEE THAT YOU NEED template, BUT I GUESS THOSE CASES WOULD BE RARE
