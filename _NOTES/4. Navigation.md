# NAVIGATION

<https://intro-nextjs-v2-instructions.vercel.app/lessons/Pages/navigation>

How Navigation Works

>> - A route transition is initiated using or calling router.push().
>> - The router updates the URL in the browserâ€™s address bar.
>> - The router avoids unnecessary work by re-using segments that haven't changed (e.g. shared layouts) from the client-side cache. This is also referred to as partial rendering.
>> - If the conditions of soft navigation are met, the router fetches the new segment from the cache rather than the server. If not, the router performs a hard navigation and fetches the Server Component payload from the server.
>> - If created, loading UI is shown from the server while the payload is being fetched.
>> - The router uses the cached or fresh payload to render the new segments on the client.

## FROM VESRSION 13, YOU DON'T NEED TO NEST ANCHOR INSIDE Link

## WHEN DEFINING PROGRAMMATIC NAVIGATION WITH `useRouter` HOOK FOR EXAMPLE; COMPONENT NEEDS TO BE CLIENT COMPONENT

YOU NEED TO USE `'use client'` (PRAGMA) ON THE TOP OF THE COMPONENT FILE

YOU CAN ALO MARK PAGE AS A CLIENT COMPONENT

I DIDN'T MENTION BUT EVERY NEXTJS COMPONENT IS SERVER COMPONENT

AND WHEN YOU AD MENTIONED "FLAG" IT BECOMES CLIENT COMPONENT

**IMPORT `useRouter` FROM `"next/navigation"`** (DO NOT USE next/router)
