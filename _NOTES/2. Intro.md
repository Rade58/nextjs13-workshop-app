# Something to notice

THIS TIME, SINCE Nextjs INTRODUCES `app` DIR, THAT ALSO INTRODUCES SOME BREAKING CHANGES AMONG OTHERS;

- `app` dir will hold our pages

- `pages` dir will hold, just our api routes (`pages/api` to be precise) (EVEN WE DID PLACE PAGES IN HERE IN PREVIOUS VERSION OF NEXTJS, BELLOW 13)
